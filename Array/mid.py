'''
a has to be a list
args could have l or r or both
if non of l nor r is presented then the function will perform the operation on the whole of a
if only l is presented the operation will be performed on range [l:]
if only r is presented the operation will be performed on range [:r]
if both are presented the operation will be performed on range [l:r]
